Gnuplot does have two techniques that are much more suitable to producing a single point.

First, if you just need a marker at a point, you can use the gnuplot object type to plot a circle at the point, e.g.

set object circle at <x>,<y> size <r>
where <x> and <y> are the coordinates of the point and <r> is the size of the circle to be drawn. The circle can be colored, 
filled, made transparent, etc., like any gnuplot object.

...

Second, if you really need a marker with a particular point style, you can use gnuplot's label command. By setting the label 
text to be empty and assigning a point type, a point will be drawn at the coordinate specified, e.g.,

set label <i> "" at <x>,<y> point pointtype <n>
sets a point with tag index <i> at the point x=<x>, y=<y> with the pointtype <n> (in default wxt terminal, n=1 is red crosses,
n=2 is green saltires, n=3 is blue asterisks, etc...)

In this way, multiple points to be plotted can be set, and a separate plot command for another function can be issued without
having to clutter the plot statement with all the single points to be plotted.
