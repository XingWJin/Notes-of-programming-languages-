number-of-tags
gives the number of integer tags that follow for the n-th element. By default, the first tag is the number of the physical entity
to which the element belongs;
the second is the number of the elementary geometrical entity to which the element belongs; 
the third is the number of mesh partitions to which the element belongs, followed by the partition ids 
(negative partition ids indicate ghost cells). A zero tag is equivalent to no tag. 
Gmsh and most codes using the MSH 2 format require at least the first two tags (physical and elementary tags).
